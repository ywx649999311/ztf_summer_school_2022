    "From your experience with the trial-and-error method above, you can see that a better method of finding test periods is needed.  This is where the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram method is used.  This method essentially measures how much power is present at each frequency within the data: more power at a certain frequency should indicate a repeating signal within the data.  However, that signal could be from a physical phenomenon, such as a pulsating star or rotating asteroid, or it could be an artifact, such as the day/night cycle or other artificial frequencies caused by the observing process.  The astronomer must interpret the data to make a final decision.\n",

    "The above data sets were relatively straightfoward to work with using the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram because the data were rather \"clean\" and did not exhibit much power at alternative frequencies.  You can find two additional data sets in the data directory for this module.  One is \"asteroid2\", which is for the asteroid 4404 Enirac observed by students at the University of Maryland in Spring 2017.  The other is \"delta-scuti\", which is for a Delta Scuti-type variable star.  You will find that both of these objects have very \"messy\" periodograms, in which is its unclear what the \"best\" period is.  You can study each of these objects by looking at subsets of the data (and running LS on the subsets), potentially temporarily eliminating data points which are outliers, and otherwise being clever in your analysis.  You can begin your analysis in the space below."
